## 🎯 About

I have started this project with the purpose of developing a Web app for the Charge King - a company providing charge stations to the nearest available location. <br/>
I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it.<br/><br/>
The Web App lands you to a Home page, in which you can know about the company along with their founders. And, also the user can contact the company for any issues or enquires.<br/>
The user can also subscribe to the company's newsletters by sharing their email id's to them.<br/>
➡️ Go try it and please let me know if you enjoyed it with a ⭐️, I would appreciate it a lot.
